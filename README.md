# Reopen current in an Incognito tab

Well that just about covers everything. 

This little extension was built because I got fed-up opening a URLs, only to find that I could not read.

```Specifically Medium pages.```

To overcome this you can copy the url, open a incognito window and paste the url, then press enter.

I am lazy so made this extension
